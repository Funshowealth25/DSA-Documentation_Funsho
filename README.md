This where i started my Data Analysis journey over a month ago. 

I have learnt quite a number of data analytical tools ranging from excel, 
SQL and currently portfolio Building which revolve around GitHub and visualize data analytical tools like Power BI

## Project Topic: E-commerce Sales Analysis
### Project Overview
A project overview provides a concise, one-page summary of a project, outlining its purpose, goals, key details, and expected outcomes. It's used to communicate project information to stakeholders, including clients, team members, and senior management. 

### Data Source

Data sources for analysis can be broadly categorized into internal and external sources. Internal sources include data generated within an organization, such as databases, CRM systems, and IoT devices. External sources include public datasets, APIs, government agencies, social media, and research publications. 

#### Internal Data Sources:
Databases: Relational databases (SQL) and NoSQL databases store structured data for analysis. 
CRM Systems: Customer Relationship Management systems hold information about customers and their interactions. 
IoT Devices: Internet of Things devices, like smart sensors, generate real-time data. 
Surveys and Forms: Online surveys, interviews, and focus groups can collect data for analysis. 
Internal Spreadsheets: Microsoft Excel spreadsheets can store and analyze data. 
Flat Files: CSVs, Excel sheets, text files, or XML/JSON formats can be used for data analysis.

#### External Data Sources:
Public Datasets: Platforms like Kaggle and data.gov provide datasets for research and analysis. 
APIs: Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow access to data from web services or applications. 
Government Agencies: Government agencies often have public datasets available for analysis. 
Social Media: Platforms like Twitter and Facebook can be analyzed for insights. 
Research Publications: Academic papers and research reports can provide data and analysis. 
Web Scraping: Tools can extract data from websites, though ethical considerations are important. 
Data Brokers: Data brokers offer access to large datasets but raise privacy concerns. 
Data Archives: Repositories for historical data and research findings. 
Subscription Services: Subscription services can provide data for analysis. 
Environmental Sensors: Data collected by environmental sensors can be used for analysis.
